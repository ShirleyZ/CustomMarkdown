# CustomMarkdown

Custom markdown for my own personal notes.

Features include:
- To do list system that allows you to mark as complete, priority, assigned, cancelled
- Bullet point system that allows you to highlight important points or questions for later on the go as you type
- Pros/Cons list system that highlights good and bad via + and - bullet points
- Headings and timestamping syntax colours to help you stay organised and timebox efforts
